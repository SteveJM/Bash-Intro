# Bash Intro

An introduction to using the Bash Command line with beginner exercises.  This is aimed at Raspberry Pi Users, although it should be useful anyone starting out with "bash".

## Contents

This course comprises a course instruction file and a number of exercise files.

## How to use

It is intended that the course is undertaken in the order presented. The course is divided into 7 parts, each comprising some tuition followed by some exercises. The course may be presented in a series of separate classes, but a whole number of parts should be presented in each session.  

The details provided in the "Course" document should be presented by the teacher / lecturer. The exercises should be given to the students as handouts for them to work through, either individually or in small groups.  

Once completed the course notes may be useful as reference material.

## Feedback

Feedback is more welcome and will be taken into consideration in future updates. You may either make a suggestion or issued a Git "Pull Request". If I get sufficient interest I will write a further course covering more advanced topics.

Enjoy!
